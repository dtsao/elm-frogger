# Frogger

Frogger is an elm-based implementation of the old standby Frogger game. To build it,
you need to following dependencies installed:

* Elm version 0.17 or greater.

You can build with:

```sh
.\build
```

This will generate a `target/elm.js` file. Once this is generated, you can visit the `index.html`
file, serving it with any web server, to play the game.

## Development

To run the tests, run the command

```sh
./test # NOTE: Not yet implemented, sorry!
```
